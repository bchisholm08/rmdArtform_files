These .Rmd files are an effort to create generative and random art in R. Much of this is inspired by the aRtsy package by Koen Derks. 
This of course uses a ggplot background. 

My goal is to develop my own generative art. This will also use ggplot behind the scenes. 

The plottyArt one and two are both attempts at my own formulas and algorithms to generate graphics. 

rArtPlayground.Rmd is half and half, with the beginning of the file being my own exploring, and playing with aRtsy later.
